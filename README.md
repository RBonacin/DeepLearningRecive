# DeepLearningRelapse
This repository includes Python code developed with Tensorflow 2.0 aiming to support the prediction cancer relapse using tabular data.

Initially, this was used as an open dataset from FOSP: https://fosp.saude.sp.gov.br/

The following publication presents this research project:
